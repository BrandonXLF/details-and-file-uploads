## Developing

### Installing dependencies

Composer is used to install dependencies. Once it is installed run `composer install` to install them.

### Running tests

Tests are run with a installation of WordPress, WooCommerce, and the WordPress test tools. These can be installed with `bin/install-wp-tests.sh [DATABASE NAME] [DATABASE USER] [DATABASE PASSWORD]`. This script requires Subversion to be installed. Once installed, run `composer run tests` to run tests.

### Code sniffing

Run `composer run phpcs` to run the code sniffer. Run `composer run phpcs:full` for a full breakdown of what errors occurred and `composer run phpcs:fix` to fix any auto-fixable errors.
